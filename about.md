I am an information technology enthusiast who has been primarily practising software development and data science. I believe that the best way to learn about the world is through logic and knowledge, and the idea of data science has amazed me ever since.

Throughout the past three years, I dedicated myself to learning development methodologies, statistics and machine learning. My proficiency in python programming, modelling and data analytics has assisted me in building some great projects such as a predictive song mood recommendation system for Spotify users, or an online proctoring software implementing facial recognition.
